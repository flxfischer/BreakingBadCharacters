# BreakingBadCharacters

I used different techniques and technologies for this little app, to should the different fields of iOS Developement.
For example:
- UIKit
- UnitTest
- SwiftUI
- Coordinators
- Transitions
- Vision & CoreML
- etc...

Not everything works perfectly, but you can seec the basics that could be done in a short amount of time.
