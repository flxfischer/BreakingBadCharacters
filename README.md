# BreakingBadCharacters

I used different techniques and technologies for this little app, to show different fields of iOS Developement.
For example:
- UIKit
- UnitTest
- SwiftUI
- Coordinators
- Transitions
- Vision & CoreML
- etc...

Not everything works perfectly, but you can see the basics that could be done in a short amount of time. 

Also to know: I used VisionKit but it works quite slow. So please wait for a couple of seconds on the Details-page, to see the effect. ;-)
